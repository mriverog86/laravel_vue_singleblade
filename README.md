# Laravel 11 + Vue 3: Single Blade Hosting a Vue.js App
Example of an API-driven integration method between Laravel 11 and Vue 3. A single Laravel blade file acts as the host for the entire Vue.js application. Both frameworks coexist within the same project directory, facilitated by the power of Viteâ€™s official plugin for Vue. This approach adopts separation of concerns principle, allowing Vue.js to function as a client-side rendered application while consuming Laravel APIs. Moreover, Vue Router, the official routing solution for Vue, will manage client-side navigation.

## Main steps

### Expose API routes:
```bash
php artisan install:api
```

### Enabled CORS policy to allow the frontend access to the API endpoints:

* Publish CORS config:
```bash
php artisan config:publish cors
```
* Setting up an environment variable in `.env` to stablish the frontend app url in order to grant CORS access:
```yml
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:5173"
```
* Loading the frontend url from `.env` and adding it to `allowed_origins` in the CORS config file located in `config/cors.php`:
  
```php
'allowed_origins' => explode(',', env('CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS', '*')),
```
